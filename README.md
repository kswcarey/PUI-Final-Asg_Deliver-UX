# Deliver UX
<p>Deliver UX is a web tool for budding designers to learn about different UX design deliverables and the product design process, while also helping them move forward in their current project. I have seen my classmates struggle with the different types of UX design outputs, so I made a website that could give them (and other designers) a hand.
<p>At the top of the site, you will see a filter bar with different points in the design process and different stakeholders. By clicking on the progress or stakeholder filters, the list will change to show you different kinds of deliverables that you could create to help you move to the next phase of your project. Another option is to simply scroll down to see the whole list, ordered by when in the process it should take place.
<p>I used Bootstrap and jQuery to create this website. I am especially proud of the custom filtering system I built, and the progress bar buttons - which I had to learn about asynchronous coding to complete.
